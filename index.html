        <p>I am an aspiring graphic designer pursuing an associate's degree in multimedia art and design at <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/">BMCC</a>. Although I'm studying to be a graphic designer, I have a wide range of interests I'd like to pursue such as cake decorating and body piercing. On my free time, I like to study astrology and watch tv shows.</p>
