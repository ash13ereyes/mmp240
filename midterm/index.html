        <p>Writer, director and comedian Nathan Fielder (CBC's "This Hour Has 22 Minutes") also has a business degree, and he combines that knowledge with his unusual life experiences to help struggling small businesses boost their sales. However, Fielder's marketing campaigns for each business can best be described as unorthodox, to the point where no traditional sales consultant would ever attempt what he does.</p>
